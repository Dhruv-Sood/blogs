# Hacks for Keeping Your Computer Science Fire Burning

Well, as a first-year computer science student, I know I may be a bit of a newbie when it comes to tech. But, despite my lack of experience, I've already learned a ton in just the past three months. And one of the most interesting things I've discovered is the power of challenges to keep me motivated as a developer.

One challenge in particular that I've found to be super helpful is the #100DaysOfCode challenge. The idea is simple: commit to coding something every day for 100 days, and share your progress on social media, mostly on Twitter. Not only does this challenge help keep me accountable and motivated, but it also provides a great opportunity to connect with other developers and newbies in the tech community.

And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like the feeling of accomplishment when you see your tweets getting more and more views and engagement. Learning in public is a great way to push yourself to improve and the encouragement and advice you get from the community are invaluable.

So, if you're a computer science student or developer looking for a way to stay motivated and connected to the tech community, I highly recommend giving the #100DaysOfCode challenge a try. It's a fun and rewarding way to grow as a developer and keep your computer science mojo going strong.

Another way that you can keep your computer science burning is to start making blogs. Writing blogs is a great way to do it! Sharing your learnings and experiences in words can really bring your learning to the next level. Just like I mentioned the #100daysofcode challenge in this article, writing a blog is the perfect follow-up to that. Not only will you be taking your "learning in public" to new heights, but you'll also get some well-deserved exposure. And here's the best part - even if you're still a beginner or a seasoned pro, there's always someone who could learn from your experiences. In other words, you're not only levelling up your own skills, but you're also giving back to the community!

Wrapping up, being a computer science student or developer is awesome, but it can be tough to keep the motivation and connection to the tech community going strong. That's why challenges like the #100DaysOfCode and writing blogs are the bomb! They're a chance to get better, connect with others, and give back all at the same time. So, if you haven't tried either one of these yet, do yourself a favour and give 'em a shot. Trust me, you won't regret it. The more effort you put in, the more awesome rewards you'll get. Happy coding, friends!
