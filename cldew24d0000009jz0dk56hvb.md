# Why Computer Science is Like a Box of Chocolates: You Never Know What You're Gonna Get

So, this blog is all about how computer science in our heads is like a fantasy, but in the real world, it's a whole different story. Buckle up, folks, it's gonna be a wild ride.

Yo, so when I was a kid, I was all about technology. I mean, I still am today. I used to wonder how all these games and stuff were made, like how do windows work and where does the sound come from on speakers? As I got older, I started looking for answers to all my childhood questions.

When I was young, I used to search for fun things like how to make a game and stuff, and then I'd come across videos talking about the tech stack used to develop it. But I'd get bored and move on to the next thing. But deep down, I always thought learning how to make games and websites would be super easy. I was naive, but we all are at some point, right?

But as I grew up and delved deeper into the tech world, I realized that things were not as simple as I thought. I mean, just to make a basic game, you gotta learn a ton of different coding languages and it can take forever to make something as simple as a website or a game. Plus, the bugs you gotta deal with, the complex algorithms, math and physics, it's insane! But all this made me realize that the developers are the real MVPs. My respect for them grew a million times more than before.

Nowadays, we got games like Fortnite and all that, and there are so many tools like Wix, WordPress, and Hashnode that make it easy to create personal blogs. Not to mention, the new AI tools like ChatGPT that are all over the internet. But just think about all the work and resources that went into developing all that stuff. It's crazy, right?

Alright, listen up all you tech-curious folks out there! If you're thinking about diving into the world of computer science and technology, let me tell you, it's not all fun and games (although, it is pretty fun and you can make some cool games). But let's get real, it's not as easy as it seems. When we were kids, we probably thought making a game or website was just a matter of clicking a few buttons and boom, done. But in reality, it's a whole different story.

First of all, there are a ton of different programming languages to learn. It's like learning a new language, except you're not trying to impress a cute Italian girl, you're trying to impress your computer. And trust me, your computer is a tough critic(It doesn't care how much time you spend to look good).

And let's not forget about the bugs. Oh boy, the bugs. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, except the needle is a tiny little typo and the haystack is a million lines of code. And when you finally find that little bugger, you'll feel like a detective solving a mystery.

But the worst part, in my opinion, is math and physics. I mean, I thought I was done with math and physics after high school but no, they just keep coming back. But, it's not all bad, I promise. It makes you feel smart and it's kind of satisfying when you finally understand how it all works.

And let's not forget that there's a lot of time, effort and resources that goes into creating something as simple as a game or website. It's like building a house, but instead of bricks, you're using code and instead of a hammer, you're using a keyboard.

But don't let all that discourage you, because even though it's a challenging field, it's also one of the most exciting and interesting fields out there. There's always something new to learn and explore and with the constant evolution of technology, the possibilities are endless. Plus, the sense of accomplishment when you finally solve a problem or create something that works, it's like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

So if you're thinking about diving into the world of computer science and technology, just remember that it's not easy, but it's definitely worth it. Embrace the challenges, make jokes and have fun with it.
