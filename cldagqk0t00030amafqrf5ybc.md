# What is git for beginners

Hey there! So, if you're just starting on your programming journey, you might have heard of something called version control systems (VCS) and thought "what the heck are those?" Trust me, I totally get it. They might sound super complicated and out of this world, but the truth is, once you dive in, they're not so bad. In fact, I think a lot of people overhype how difficult they are.

### So, what exactly are VCSs?

Simply put, they're systems that store the history of all the different versions of a project. Think of it like a history book for your code. It keeps track of every change that's made, who made it, and when. This way, you can see how your project has evolved over time, and also collaborate with other people on the same project. And if you ever mess up and break something, no worries! VCSs also have this cool feature called **rollback**, which lets you go back to an earlier version and fix it.

### Understanding with an example

Let me give you an example to make it more clear. Let's say you're building a calculator app.

* On day one, you add the basic addition and subtraction functionality (Version 1).
    
* On day two, you add multiplication (Version 2).
    
* On day three, you accidentally break it (Version 3).
    

With a VCS like Git, you can easily go back to the working version (Version 2) and fix the problem.

**Now imagine working on this project with friends.**

* On day four, your friends John and Jacob join in. Every time they make a change to the project, it's recorded in Git.
    
* On day five, when John adds a factorial function
    
* On day six, the code poops out again
    

Now with Git you can figure out who broke the code and fix it.

In short, VCSs like Git are super important for any programmer. They make it easy to track changes, collaborate with others, and fix bugs. And the best part is, once you get the hang of it, it's actually pretty simple to use. So don't be intimidated, give it a try and see how it can make your life easier!

### All the best!!

Get ready to Git-r-done! Buckle up and hold onto your code, because you're about to embark on an epic journey through the wild world of version control. Sure, you might run into a few roadblocks and bugs along the way, but don't worry - that's all part of the fun! Just remember to take it one commit at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. And most importantly, don't forget to have a little fun and enjoy the ride! Good luck, and happy coding!
